			<td colspan="2">Nursery
				An application form for nursery can be obtained from the school.

				Children can be entered on the list from their second birthday onwards. The school’s admission policy follows the Lewisham guidelines.

				Priority is given to:

				Children in Public care
				Children who have identified Special Educational Needs- supported by documentation
				Brothers and sisters living at the same address and attending Baring Primary or Nursery School
				Baring Nursery School is the nearest school
				The Lewisham 2 point of entry admission policy means that children should be offered 3 or 4 terms in the Nursery and that at least one of these terms can be full-time, before entry to main school, subject to availability of places.

				A PLACE IN THE NURSERY DOES NOT GUARANTEE A PLACE IN THE MAIN SCHOOL

				When applying for a place to start Reception in September, parents must APPLY using the Common Application Form (CAF).

				Main School – Reception Class
				Places in main school are offered as follows:

				In September for children who reach their fifth birthday between 1st September and 31st  August
				In January for children who reach their fifth birthday between 1st March and 31st August and whose parents prefer them to begin Reception class at this time. (http://www.lewisham.gov.uk/myservices/education/schools/school-admission/applying-to-start-primary-school/Pages/The-age-at-which-children-start-pimary-school.aspx)
				By law children must  receive full-time education from the beginning of the school term following their fifth birthday, We have a policy of offer a school place earlier as a ‘rising five’.  From September 2012, there will be a single point of entry to reception class in September.  Parents can ask to defer entry, but not beyond the beginning of the term after their child becomes </td>

			<td colspan="2">Advise your child to speak to an adult in the school. This can be any member of staff that they feel comfortable with. You may also wish to support your child by talking to the teacher with your child.  We would encourage that they report any incident to the class teacher as they can observe behaviour during lessons and advise lunchtime staff as necessary. We take accusations of bullying very seriously and any incidents are dealt with appropriately and with speed. If you are concerned about your child please speak to the head teacher and never approach a child or the parent.</td>
